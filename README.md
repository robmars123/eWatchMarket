Architecture Principles
# Domain-Driven Design: Each feature lives in its own folder with controller, service, model, and routes.

# Separation of Concerns: Configs, middleware, and business logic are isolated.

# Environment-Driven: .env powers all runtime settings.

# Scalable Routing: route.ts centralizes all domain routes.
